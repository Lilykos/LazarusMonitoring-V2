Lazarus: The WiFi Monitoring Software (version 2)
===================

The final version of Lazarus Monitoring. It includes integration with web services so that it can be used from many PCs sending data to a deployed web service.

The execution is similar to the v1 of LazarusMonitoring, only this time instead of using the standard output, all the data are being sent to the web service, which saves them in a MySQL database and presents them through a GUI.
